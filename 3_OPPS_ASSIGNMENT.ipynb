    "A2->  Abstraction and Encapsulation are two important concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user. It is used to manage complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data and methods into a single unit or object. It is used to protect data from unauthorized access by making it private and providing public methods to access it.\n",

    "For example, let’s say you have a class called Car. The class has properties like make, model, year, etc. These properties are private and can only be accessed through public methods like getMake(), getModel(), etc. This is an example of encapsulation because the data is hidden from the user and can only be accessed through public methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, abstraction is used to hide the implementation details of a class. For example, let’s say you have an abstract class called Shape. The class has an abstract method called draw(). This method is implemented by its subclasses like Circle, Rectangle, etc. The user only knows that there is a method called draw() which can be called on any shape object. The implementation details of how each shape is drawn are hidden from the user."
